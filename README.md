AI tutor feedback validation using blockchain.
AI Tutor Feedback Validation Using Blockchain
Description
The AI Tutor Feedback Validation system leverages blockchain technology to ensure that feedback provided by AI tutors for students is secure, transparent, and immutable. By storing feedback on the blockchain, this system guarantees that the feedback is not tampered with and is easily accessible by both students and tutors. A supervisor or an authorized party validates the feedback, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the feedback process. This decentralized approach promotes accountability and transparency in AI-assisted education.

Vision of the Project
The vision of the AI Tutor Feedback Validation project is to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized solution for storing and validating AI-generated feedback in the educational space. By utilizing blockchain, this project ensures that all feedback provided by AI tutors remains immutable, validated, and accessible to all relevant parties. This ensures trust in AI-driven education, providing a robust framework for transparent assessments, feedback tracking, and learning outcomes evaluation.

Future Scope
The future scope of this project includes:

Expanding User Roles: Implement additional roles like students, AI tutors, administrators, and others with specific permissions for validation, feedback provision, and monitoring.

Integration with AI Models: Link the system directly with AI models that generate feedback, enabling real-time feedback provision and tracking.

Feedback Quality Validation: Introduce mechanisms for automatic or manual validation of the quality of AI-generated feedback, such as checks for accuracy, relevance, and clarity.

Enhanced UI: Develop a user interface for easy interaction with the system, making it accessible for students, tutors, and supervisors to check feedback status, retrieve feedback, and validate submissions.

Cross-Platform Integration: Expand this blockchain-based feedback system for use in educational platforms, learning management systems (LMS), and other AI-powered educational tools to enable broad adoption across different platforms.
